    <div id="intro">
        My name is Dustin Blair Naylor. I was born in Walnut Creek, California but have spent most of my life in
        Kaysville, UT. Below is a map of Kaysville.

        I served a mission in Vancouver, British Columbia and loved the beautiful scenery up in Canada.

<div class = "hiddenDiv">
    As you can tell from the picture of me to the right, I love Saab. I've owned my 1990 Saab 900 SPG for about a
    year and a half now and have just fallen in love with it. I've probably spent too much money on fixing it
    up and tuning it to quite the peppy little car
   <p> I also enjoy some good old video games. I know, how cliche. But I do. Thankfully though I'm not a crazed
    addict like some people. I also enjoy getting outside. My wife and I have been running for the last month now and
       preparing to race in the Mt. Nebo Half-Marathon in August! Yikes.</p>
    <p>Aside form that I like random things like kayaking, disc golf, racquetball, and watching tv shows.</p>

<div class="section">Family</div>
<div class = "hiddenDiv">
    <p>I come from a family of 6 kids, me being number five in the line up. I have 2 older sisters, Shantel and Breanne,
    2 older brothers, Chris and Steve, and one baby brother who isn't really a baby as he's 21, Andrew. My Dad just turned
        60 this year! What an old fart!</p>
    <p>Last year in July I got married to my wonderful wife, Jacqueline. I met her in highschool almost 6 years ago now.
        We currently live in Kaysville and we're both attending school and working</p>

<div class="section">My Experience with CS-185</div>
<div class = "hiddenDiv">
    <p>I'd have to say that this year this class has got to be the class I learned the most in. I feel like
    this class actually gave me the ability to produce something someone could use.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing I learned in this class was by far jQuery. It is fantastic! I love the ability to
    animate with it and to make api calls. It just really makes the connection between html/css and
    javascript to me.</p>
    <p>The hardest part of this class was, by far, Angular 2. It made....no sense. None at all. And like you
    said, Angular is just too hard to try and learn in 3 weeks. It isn't something that belongs in
    a beginning level Javascript coarse.</p>
    <p>Below is a little input box that will put what you type into it into it's own cute little box!</p>

        <input id="userInput" type="text">
        <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="submit()">
